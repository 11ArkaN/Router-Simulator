# Router Simulator

**Status: Work in progress. This is not a complete Nokia SR OS implementation.**

Router Simulator is a browser-based network emulator that runs in real time. You build a topology of modular routers and hosts, provision their hardware, and drive them from a CLI, while a packet engine underneath moves real Ethernet, ARP, IPv4 and ICMP frames across the links. A ping succeeds only when its packet is actually forwarded, queued and delivered.

Router Simulator is an independent, unofficial educational project. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by or produced by Nokia. The application uses Nokia SR OS 26.7.R1 documentation as a behavior reference. It does not use the Nokia logo and does not claim full product compatibility.

## Implemented capabilities

A lab holds up to 16 routers, 16 hosts and 64 physical links. Routers come from generated 7750 SR-1, SR-7 and SR-12 catalogs, and you provision their cards and MDAs from whatever combinations the catalog allows. Insertion, removal and type mismatches are all handled. Ports aren't fixed up front. They appear as you equip the chassis, card and MDA inventory, and the model keeps inventory, provisioning, running and operational state apart instead of merging them.

Every console runs the MD-CLI and classic CLI engines in one session. MD-CLI edits land as transactions, classic edits take effect immediately. The terminal carries prompts, context navigation, completion, line editing, three history regions and paging. Its visible window stays virtualized while the full transcript is archived to OPFS.

The packet plane is the point of the whole thing. Frames are encoded, serialized onto links with propagation delay and bounded queues, and forwarded for real. ARP is learned and aged. Connected and static routes feed RIB selection and versioned FIB generations, and IPv4 forwarding covers TTL, fragmentation, Path MTU and ICMP errors. Host and router pings ride real packets, so failing a link or pulling a line card cascades through everything downstream.

Live traffic can be captured at link, ingress, egress and CPM points and exported as PCAPNG that `tshark` opens cleanly. A project saves to `.netsim` as portable intent or as a full structural checkpoint, and import is locked to the matching profile.

Routers and hosts are dragged onto the canvas, and a link picks its physical ports when you connect it. The topology, inspector, sidebar and terminal panels resize on desktop. Below 900px the sidebar folds into a drawer and the inspector into an overlay.

## Architecture

The packet runtime is written in C++20 and compiled with Emscripten to WebAssembly. It runs outside the React thread and requires pthreads with shared WebAssembly memory.

At startup, the generated CPU policy creates one, three or five pthreads in addition to the browser control Worker. Hosts with up to four logical CPUs use one control owner and one combined forwarding and link owner. Hosts with five to eight logical CPUs use one control, two forwarding and one link owner. Larger hosts use two control, three forwarding and one link owner. Stable device handles select owner shards and live devices do not migrate. Shared packet state does not cross the browser boundary through per-packet `postMessage` calls.

The runtime uses the host monotonic clock. It has no simulation timeline, global future-event heap, pause control, step control or speed multiplier. Protocol and hardware deadlines pass in real time.

Main components:

- React, Vite and TanStack Router for the application shell
- React Flow for topology rendering
- xterm.js for terminal rendering
- lucide-react for the interface icons
- C++20 for hardware, configuration, CLI, routing, packet processing and capture
- WebAssembly pthreads and `SharedArrayBuffer` for the runtime
- IndexedDB for project metadata
- OPFS for terminal history, checkpoints and binary captures

The C++ core has no dependency on React, the DOM, xterm.js, IndexedDB or OPFS.

## Current scope

The hard ceilings are 16 routers, 16 hosts, 64 links and four terminal sessions per router. Hardware is whatever the active release catalog defines, down to its Ethernet card functions and port layouts, and the CLI exposes only the commands its capability matrix backs. The IPv4 and host stacks cover the functions above rather than the full RFC surface. The larger parts of SR OS, its routing protocols, services, MPLS, QoS, HA and management, aren't built yet. Card and MDA initialization times are emulator profile estimates, not measured hardware.

Checkpoint import only accepts a file whose profile, checkpoint ABI and build hash match the running build. Without cross-origin isolation the runtime refuses to start at all. A command it doesn't support returns an explicit error, and it reports success only after it has actually changed router state.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 for the repository PowerShell scripts
- Node.js 22
- pnpm 11
- Chrome, Edge or Firefox with `SharedArrayBuffer` support
- PowerShell 7 or Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools for native MSVC builds
- Wireshark with `tshark` for local PCAPNG conformance tests

WSL is not required or used by the local workflow.

## Setup

Install JavaScript dependencies and the repository-local compiler toolchain:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm toolchain:bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command installs the pinned toolchain under the ignored `.tools` directory:

- Emscripten 6.0.3
- CMake 4.4.0
- Ninja 1.13.0

Publish the current WebAssembly build and start the development server:

```powershell
pnpm core:publish
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. The Vite server sends the COOP and COEP headers required by WebAssembly threads. Startup stops with an error if the page is not cross-origin isolated or any owner selected by the generated shard policy does not start.

## Build and verification

Create a production build:

```powershell
pnpm build
```

Run source validation, generated-profile checks, dependency checks, type checking, C++ and TypeScript tests, benchmark regression checks and the production build:

```powershell
pnpm verify
```

Install the Playwright-managed Firefox build and run the production browser scenario in Chrome, Edge and Firefox:

```powershell
pnpm test:e2e:install
pnpm verify:browser
```

The browser scenario verifies cross-origin isolation, every selected pthread owner, multi-router topology editing, CLI provisioning, physical insertion, routed traffic, carrier failure, project import, checkpoint import, terminal restoration and reload recovery.

Individual core commands are also available:

```powershell
pnpm core:build
pnpm core:test
pnpm core:manual
pnpm core:benchmark
pnpm core:structure-benchmark
pnpm core:runtime-benchmark
```

Native CTest builds include a PCAPNG fixture. When `tshark` is installed under `C:\Program Files\Wireshark`, CMake adds the `tshark_pcapng` conformance test automatically.

## Projects, checkpoints and captures

IndexedDB stores the active project and UI layout. OPFS stores the terminal transcript, latest capture and latest structural checkpoint.

A `.netsim` file has one of two modes:

- `project` stores portable intent, topology, hardware choices, running configuration, notes, layout and an optional capture
- `checkpoint` adds ARP, RIB, FIB, queues, packets, link transmissions, relative deadlines, counters, alarms, CLI semantics, terminal editor state, histories, queued input and pager position

An incompatible checkpoint is rejected before runtime replacement. The user can explicitly import only its project data, which starts a new runtime without the incompatible operational state.

## Sources and capability tracking

[`sources/catalog.yaml`](sources/catalog.yaml) records the normative source, release, implementation files, tests and verification status for each implemented behavior. [`sources/capabilities.yaml`](sources/capabilities.yaml) marks features as implemented, partially implemented, experimental or unsupported.

```powershell
pnpm sources:validate
```

The validator rejects missing sources, missing tests, invalid implementation paths and unknown source identifiers used by code comments.
